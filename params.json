{"name":"Dropbox Browser","tagline":"A simple iOS Dropbox Document Browser. Uses the Dropbox SDK to display and download all types of Dropbox files and directories in a UITableView (presented modally). Requires a Dropbox API App Key & Secret.","body":"# Dropbox Browser\r\nDropbox Browser provides a simple and effective way to browse, view, and download files using the iOS Dropbox SDK. Add the required files to your Xcode iOS project, setup Dropbox, add one simple method and a navigation controller and now you've got a simple TableView that lets users browse their files and folder, and even download them.\r\n\r\n##Integration\r\nTo properly integrate DropboxBrowser into your project follow the instructions below. Use the included Sample Project (inside of the \"Example\" folder) as a guide for setting up your project. \r\n \r\n1. Add the following Frameworks already available in Xcode to your project:  \r\n    - Security  \r\n    - QuartzCore  \r\n    - AssetsLibrary  \r\n    - UIKit  \r\n    - Foundation  \r\n    - CoreGraphics  \r\n2. Add the DropboxSDK Framework to your project. The latest version of the SDK can be downloaded here: https://www.dropbox.com/developers | The sample project currently uses version 1.3.4 of the Dropbox SDK  \r\n3. Register as a developer on Dropbox and setup your App. If you've already done this, skip this step. If you haven't done this, please follow this link to get setup: https://www.dropbox.com/developers/start/setup#ios  \r\n4. Setup and add the required methods used by Dropbox for authenticating. This includes customizing your Info.plist file and your App Delegate. Instructions from Dropbox are available here: https://www.dropbox.com/developers/start/authentication#ios  \r\n5. Create an IBAction that will call the `didPressLink` method, then connect that IBAction to a button that will allow users to browse their Dropbox folder.  \r\n6. Add all of the DropboxBrowser files to your project\r\n\t- `DropboxBrowserViewController`\r\n\t- `DropboxDataController`\r\n\t- `DropboxRootViewController`\r\n\t- Make sure to include the graphics and icons needed, and the `Utilities` folder along with the others\r\n7. In your ViewController's header file, add the following `#import` statement: `#import \"DropboxBrowserViewController.h\"`. Also add the following delegate: `DropboxBrowserDelegate`.\r\n8. In your Implementation File (.m) find the `didPressLink` method and substitute all current code inside with the code below. This project (and its code) assumes you're using Xcode 4, iOS 5+, and Storyboards. If you aren't using storyboards, please feel free to customize this method in the `DropboxBrowserViewController.m` for XIBs.\r\n\r\n        - (void)didPressLink {\r\n            //Check if Dropbox is Setup\r\n            if (![[DBSession sharedSession] isLinked]) {\r\n                    //Dropbox is not setup\r\n                    [[DBSession sharedSession] linkFromController:self];\r\n                    NSLog(@\"Logging into Dropbox...\");\r\n            } else {\r\n                    //Dropbox has already been setup\r\n                    //Setup DropboxBrowserViewController\r\n                    DropboxBrowserViewController *browser = [[DropboxBrowserViewController alloc] init];\r\n                    [browser setDelegate:self];\r\n        \r\n                   //Setup Storyboard. If you aren't using iPad, set the iPad Storyboard the same as the iPhone Storyboard. If you have an iPad-only project, set the iPhone Storyboard as NIL.\r\n                   UIStoryboard *iPhoneStoryboard = [UIStoryboard storyboardWithName:@\"MainStoryboard_iPhone\" bundle:[NSBundle mainBundle]];\r\n                   UIStoryboard *iPadStoryboard = [UIStoryboard storyboardWithName:@\"MainStoryboard_iPad\" bundle:[NSBundle mainBundle]];\r\n        \r\n                  //Present Dropbox Browser. The following method requires you to set a storyboard to use, a view controller to present the DropboxBrowser on, modal presentation and transition styles, and a delegate which you set above.\r\n                 [DropboxBrowserViewController displayDropboxBrowserInPhoneStoryboard:iPhoneStoryboard displayDropboxBrowserInPadStoryboard:iPadStoryboard onView:self  withPresentationStyle:UIModalPresentationFormSheet withTransitionStyle:UIModalTransitionStyleFlipHorizontal withDelegate:self];    } }\r\n\r\n9. Next, Implement the following delegate functions to handle the dismissal of the Dropbox Browser:\r\n\r\n         - (void)removeDropboxBrowser {\r\n             //This is where you can handle the cancellation of selection, ect.\r\n             [self dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:nil];\r\n         }  \r\nPlease refer to the **Delegates & Results** section of this document to learn more about different delegate methods and what they do.  \r\n10. The next step is to edit the required interface files. In your storyboard, add the following UI Objects from the Objects Library:\r\n    - Navigation Controller  \r\n11.  Click on the root of the navigation controller you just added. Change its class to `DropboxBrowserViewController` using the Identity Inspector. Change the Storyboard ID to `DropboxBrowserID` and then check the \"Use Storyboard ID\" checkbox\r\n12. Select the Table View Controller just added along with the Navigation Controller and change the class to `DropboxRootViewController` using the Identity Inspector.\r\n13. Click on the first cell of the Table View and change its identifier to `DropboxBrowserCell`\r\n\r\nIf you have completed everything properly the navigation controller will present itself modally over the current view controller (when the `didPressLink` method is fired). Please refer to the sample project included.\r\n\r\n## Delegates & Results\r\nThere are two delegate methods available with DropboxBrowser (not Dropbox SDK), both of which provide a way to know when the user performs one out of two possible actions. The first *required* delegate method is called when the user taps 'Done':\r\n\r\n    - (void)removeDropboxBrowser {\r\n         //This is where you can handle the cancellation of selection, ect.\r\n     }  \r\n  \r\nThis method is *required* and should be used to dismiss the DropboxBrowser by using the `dismissViewControllerAnimated` method. The next delegate method is the response to downloading a file. Files from DropboxBrowser are **always** downloaded to your **application's Documents Directory**. This method is triggered after a file is downloaded:\r\n\r\n    - (void)refreshLibrarySection {\r\n        //This is where you can update your UI or dismiss the DropboxBrowser when the user downloads a file.\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe next function allows you to retrieve the file name of the last file selected. Simply call this function:\r\n\r\n        NSString *fileName = [DropboxRootViewController fileName];\r\n  \r\nThis function returns an NSString and can best be utilized in the `refreshLibrarySection` method.\r\n    \r\n## User Interface\r\nDropboxBrowser has a nice UI that can easily be customized. All graphics have been Retina-Display, and iPhone 5 optimized. A quick preview of what the UI looks like can be seen below. \r\n\r\n<img width=750 src=\"https://github.com/iRareMedia/DropboxBrowser/blob/master/Screenshot.png?raw=true\"/>\r\n\r\nHere are a few simple ways to customize the interface:  \r\n - Swap any images (PNGs) included with Dropbox Browser with your own. Use the same size image with the exact same name (unless you want to change it in the code).  \r\n - Use UITableView Prototype Cells to customize the TableView appearance. It is recommended that you set the cell type to `Subtitle`. This will allow DropboxBrowser to display file / folder names, last modified dates, and file sizes.  \r\n - Change the UIColors in `DropboxBrowserViewController` and `DropboxRootViewController`. In the `DropboxBrowserViewController`'s `viewDidLoad` method you can change the tint of the UINavigationBar. In the `DropboxRootViewController`'s `viewDidLoad` method you can change the tint of the `UIRefeshControl` (iOS 6+ only), the UINavigationBar title, and the position of the UIProgressView.  \r\n \r\n## Change Log\r\nThis project is now ready for primetime use in any iOS application. Just follow the steps above to integrate Dropbox Browser. Here are a few key changes in the project:\r\n\r\n**Version 3.0**  \r\n\t- Code reorganized, cleaned-up, and many comments have been added  \r\n\t- Back button now goes up one level instead of returning to the Root Directory. Back button also only appears when the user is not in the Root Directory (i.e. they have somewhere to back up to).\r\n\t- Improved Download Progress View. Now centered in the Navigation Bar and hides NavBar title when shown.\r\n\t- Any file type is shown in DropboxBrowser - no file types are excluded\r\n\t- Duplicate `@implementation` calls have been removed and condesed into one implementation  \r\n\t- New iOS 6 features including `UIRefreshControl` have been added  \r\n\t- New design. Removed accessory buttons from UITableViewCells. Updated graphics. Added Dropbox-esque tint to `UINavgationBar` and `UIRefreshControl`  \r\n\t- Sample project now has an icon and uses Autolayout instead of Autosizing (may have caused build errors for iOS 5 in older versions of DropboxBrowser)  \r\n\t- Dropbox SDK updated to version 1.3.4  \r\n\t- Renamed classes. Generally removed `Kiosk` and `PDF` from all class names and delegates.\r\n\t- Numerous minor bug fixes and improvements\r\n\t- Improved performance  \r\n\r\n**Version 2.3**  \r\n\t- Condenses presentation of DropboxBrowser to four lines (compared to a previous 40+ lines of code) using one simple method  \r\n\t- New convenience method.  \r\n**Version 2.2**  \r\n\t- Dropbox Browser now fits all screen sizes using Autosizing instead of defined sizes - in other words, iPhone 5 compatibility  \r\n**Version 2.1**  \r\n\t- Updated Documentation  \r\n\t- New Methods  \r\n\t- Improved Selection  \r\n**Version 2.0**  \r\n\t- Added Sample Project  \r\n\t- iOS 6 Support  \r\n\t- ARC Support  \r\n\t- New Documentation  \r\n\t- Improved ReadMe  \r\n\t- Improved UI  \r\n\t- More!  \r\n\r\n**Version 1.2**  \r\n\t- Added Download Indicator  \r\n**Version 1.1**  \r\n\t- Added Sync Functionality  \r\n**Version 1.0**  \r\n\t- Initial Commit\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
